### 1. What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an open-source database system. It helps store and manage data in a reliable way.It is an RDMS which is software to manage relation model based data,

### 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
A database schema is a way to organize tables and other objects in the database. It we use when our project is huge and we  want to separate our database by some schemas.By default postgres use public schema.

### 3. Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL
**Primary Key:** Primary Key an unique identifier for each a row in a table. The condition is it should be unique, can't be null. 

**Foreign Key:** Primary Key is way to make relation between two tables. It references the primary key of another table to create a relationship.

### 4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?
**VARCHAR:** A unfixed-length string. It uses only the needed space.We can give just a max length and it will just take less or equal length of the max width.

**CHAR:** A fixed-length string. It always uses the specified fixed length

### 5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement
The WHERE clause filters records in a SELECT statement. It allows you to specify conditions that the records must meet to be included in the results.

### 6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?
**LIMIT:** Limits the number of rows returned by a query.

**OFFSET:** Skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows.

### 7. How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?
Use the UPDATE statement to change existing records in a table. For example:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 8 What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?
The JOIN operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. It helps retrieve data from multiple tables in one query.

### 9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations
The GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values in specified columns. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG to perform calculations on each group.

### 10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?
Use aggregate functions to perform calculations on a set of values:

**COUNT:** Counts the number of rows.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
**SUM:** Adds up the values.
```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
**AVG:** Calculates the average value.
```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### 11. What is the purpose of an index in PostgreSQL, and how does it optimize query performance?
An index in PostgreSQL is like a shortcut that helps the database find data faster. Just like a book index helps you locate a specific topic without reading the whole book, an index allows the database to quickly look up and access the data you need. This speeds up search queries, but problem is, we should not use too much indexing, because it takes extra storage. It is recommended to use indexing in foreign keys in every table.

### 12. Explain the concept of a PostgreSQL view and how it differs from a table.
A PostgreSQL view is a virtual table, for that you can reuse your sql query logic. It doesn't store any data itself but shows data from one or more tables based on the query you defined. It is import when we read something in database and the query is complex and we don't like to write the same query every time.
